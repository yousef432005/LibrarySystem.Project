# LibrarySystem.Project
This is a simple library system
1- As a user, I want to have a library card so that I can borrow books from the library.

2- As a Librarian, I want to add new books to the library’s collection so that they can be available for borrowing.

3- As a librarian, I want to remove books from the library’s collection so that we can keep the collection up-to-date.

4- As a Librarian, I want to display a list of all the books in the library’s collection so that users can easily find books they are interested in.
